Question 2. Cryptanalysis of WEP
Discuss the vulnerabilities of the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol.
Your answer should explain the major weaknesses that make WEP insecure and susceptible to attacks.

Answer: The major vulnerability of WEP is that the first few bytes of the output keystream are not random, which leaks information about the key.
If the long-term key and nonce are simply concatenated to generate the RC4 key, this long-term key can be discovered by analyisng a large number of messages encryped with this key. This and related effects were then used to break the WEP encryption. 



3. Security Issues in Diffie–Hellman
Discuss the vulnerabilities that arise in the Diffie–Hellman key exchange when the generator g is not a primitive root and when p is not prime.

Answer: The vulenerability that arises is that it then demand much larger values of a, b, and p to make it secure, as its easy to try all the possible values of g^ab mod x (there will be at most x values even if a and b are large),
while if P is a prime more than 300 digits and a nd b are at least 100 digits wrong, even the most efficient known algorithms would take longer than the lifetime of the universe to run.
